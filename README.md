# Hand Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project focuses on detecting hands in images using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. It includes a Jupyter Notebook named "hand_detection.ipynb" where the code is implemented. The detected hand images are stored as frames in a folder named "output_images" using UUID for unique filenames.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file "hand_detection.ipynb".
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment.
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code.
4. Detected hand images will be stored in the "output_images" folder within the project directory.

## Files Included

- `hand_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for hand detection.
- `output_images/`: Folder to store the detected hand images.
